# TinCity Metrobus Analysis in Power BI

This repository contains the analysis of the TinCity Metrobus system based on synthetic data, performed using Power BI. The analysis covers various aspects of bus operations, including passenger flow, delays, and external factors such as weather conditions.

## Overview

The project answers the following key questions related to the TinCity Metrobus system:

### 1. Temporal and Operational Data

### 2. Environmental and External Conditions

### 3. Passenger and Stop-specific Factors

### 4. Operational Efficiency and Performance

## Power BI Report

The analysis was created using Power BI, and the interactive report is contained in the `pbix/` file:

- `tincitymetro.pbix`: The Power BI report file, which contains all of the visualizations and data transformations for the analysis.

To open the report:
1. Install Power BI Desktop if you don't already have it: https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/
2. Open the `tincitymetro.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.

## Data Sources

The following synthetic data sources were used for the analysis:
- `synthetic_bus_data.csv`: Contains data on passenger counts, waiting times, timestamps, bus schedules related operational data, weather conditions and related data.

For details on the structure and fields of each data source, refer to the `documentation/` folder.
